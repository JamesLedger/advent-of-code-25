# Advent of code

Each day I want to use a different language to calculate the solution. Only 12 days this year with 2 challenges per day, I might only just do one per day though.

It's more about learning about new languages and how they're set up. Starting with easy ones, going into more obscure as we go on.

# 12 Days

Day 1 - Python ⭐
Day 2 - Typescript
